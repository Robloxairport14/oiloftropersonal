        [What is the difference between this website and the bigger competitor versions like Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Voice, Discord, etcetera? Let us just say that metaphorically, this website is like a toy hammer that is safe and helps with “Wack A Moll” or toy nails, while there are adult hammers that are more dangerous to kids without them knowing how to properly use it, the adults are aware with its purpose. Such as in reality, the adults know how to use Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Voice, Discord, etcetera. The adults are more fully aware of using those platforms, but the children might not, just like they did not about the use of cell phones, risk calling 9-1-1 just to see what happens. This website will help keep one specific form of curiosity in a safe way to know how it works so the kids can adapt into adults for Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Google Voice, Discord, etcetera. Another reason this website is safe like a toy hammer is because anyone who is new to online communication can practice on themselves without the need to talk to strangers. The only way to talk to someone else is if there are two or more number of input devices such as cameras, microphones, or both connected to one computer or desktop.]

        [What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site? Simply to test if the microphone that the visitor uses is working. Instead of just going to a default voice recording application and check and see if you can hear yourself, just come on to this page to make sure people can and will hear you with in good enough quality. Visitors needs help and assistance while having things less complicated without the need to do much just to make sure they are ready to go, virtually. Having a microphone is the first half important requirement for this website to make sure that the visitors are heard from a far instead of yelling to the neighbors. In most cases, other people may not hear the user, but at least it is worth a shot to use their first amendment rights, especially when it is more impossible to share verbal information if it is kept to themselves, but it would be a waste of time if a visitor comes to this website and does not even use it whatsoever at all.]

        [Why will people come to your site? The first reason is that the visitor or visitors will have a fun way talking to themselves offline or have a fun way of playing telephone. The second reason is that whatever is said or heard is closed circuit, which means that no other visitor can really hear the other visitor for privacy reasons, and just to be sure, this website will have a privacy policy. The third reason is that the visitors can also check if their speakers or head set also works. Visitors could just test them on YouTube easily by searching or choosing a random video with turning up the video and the computer’s volume, but the only problem with that is that YouTube uses more data to load, search, and play videos while this website just does a small test sound as well as your custom sound or words the visitor speaks on the microphone section of this website. Having a speaker or headset is the second half important requirement for this website to make sure that the visitors can listen to future information of whatever the visitor is going to listen to on their computer.]
